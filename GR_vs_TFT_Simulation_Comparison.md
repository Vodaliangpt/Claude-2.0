**Prepared for: Independent AI Reviewer**

## Simulation Objective
To compare General Relativity (GR) and Time Force Theory (TFT) predictions across identical initial conditions using two independent cosmological simulations.

Each simulation starts from a shared set of boundary conditions and physical constants.  
Both evolve the system forward from an initial singularity or pre-expansion state.

## Universe Conditions (Shared Start Point)
- **Initial Energy State**: Uniform density singularity  
- **Mass-Energy Total**: 1.3 × 10^53 kg  
- **Spacetime Topology**: Flat initial manifold  
- **Entropy Level**: Low (near-zero complexity)  
- **Initial Vector Fields**:  
  - GR: Curved spacetime metric only  
  - TFT: Time vector field \vec{T} initialized from manifold rupture
