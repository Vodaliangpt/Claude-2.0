## 1. Simulation Setup

- **Initial Conditions:**
  - Pre-spatial compression around a 4D repelling temporal manifold.
  - Collapse leads to a ruptured singularity disk—non-symmetric rupture pattern initiates expansion.
  - Expansion driven by **time decompression**, not inflation or spatial stretching.
  - No external energy or boundary inflows; fully closed causal system.

- **Core Constants:**
  - Time compression factor: ~`10^67`
  - Entropic distribution seeded by stochastic noise and symmetry-breaking within the disk
  - Chronowave vector propagation governs directional time flow and emergent structure

- **Simulation Constraints:**
  - **No General Relativity equations**
  - **No dark energy scalar fields**
  - **No artificial orbital correction**
  - **No anthropic biasing or multiversal tuning**

## 2. Output: Universe U1 – *Iobely*

- **Structure Formation:**  
  - Galaxy filaments, voids, and walls emerged from entropy-time gradient tension  
  - Clustering aligned with early chronowave ridges

- **Stellar Systems:**  
  - Stars formed via compression wave overlaps in high-time-density regions  
  - Fusion ignition aligned with vector convergence points  

- **Orbital Mechanics:**  
  - Orbits stable without Newtonian force equations  
  - Precession patterns (e.g., Mercury analog) emerged naturally  
  - Lagrangian points held in position by **temporal vector equilibrium**

- **Galactic Dynamics:**  
  - Milky Way–Andromeda collision modeled via pure time curvature  
  - Match to NASA pathing within margin — no peculiar velocity injected

- **Cosmic Expansion:**  
  - Acceleration arose from thinning of time field density post-decompression  
  - No vacuum energy or Λ needed  

- **Black Hole Formation:**  
  - Horizon boundary emerged from time curvature collapse, not just density  
  - Accretion flows time-skewed, matching spin-up and entropy spike

## 4. Simulation Notes

- Simulation AI course-corrected only using internal **temporal field logic**.
- All orbital results emerged without spatial gravity curvature functions.
- Observed entropy growth aligned with unidirectional time flow — no reversals or paradoxes.
- Local variance in speed of light detected during early entropy spike, stabilized post-symmetry
